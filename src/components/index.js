export { default as WarehouseList } from "./WarehouseList/WarehouseList"
export { default as WarehouseListItem } from "./WarehouseListItem/WarehouseListItem"

//example
// export { default as Header } from "./Header/Header";
// export { default as COMPONENT_NAME } from "./COMPONENT_NAME/COMPONENT_NAME";

//then other components just need to reference this 'index.js' file to import all components in this '\components' folder
